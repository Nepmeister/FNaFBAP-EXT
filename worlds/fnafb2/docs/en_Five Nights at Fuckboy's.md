# Five Nights at Fuckboy's (PC)

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file. Some options can only be made in YAML, but an explanation can be found in the
[template yaml here](../../../static/generated/configs/Five%20Nights%20at%20Fuckboy%27s.yaml).

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Party members, skills, weapons, armors, quest items, etc. have been added to the item pool.

Locations to be checked include chests, major fights, B.B. shops, and quests.
Optionally, Levelups and Trade Vouchers may also send locations.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

General items like weapons, armors, and healers will simply be put into your inventory.
Party members will instantly be added to your party.
The B.B. Shops and the Interior Walls entrance will automatically appear once recieved.
